## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- **Header, footer, and main content body**
- **Navigation elements** - I dropped the underlines and changed the color for anchor elements.
- **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks great on all window sizes and devices
- **Application elements** - Used good contrast and whitespace
- **Application text content** - Consistent fonts

## JavaScript deliverable

For this deliverable I implemented by JavaScript so that the application works for a single user. I also added placeholders for future technology.

- **login** - When you press enter or the login button it takes you to the create page.
- **database** - Click the submit button and the data will be stored. Currently this is stored and retrieved from local storage, but it will be replaced with the database data later.
- **WebSocket** - This will be implement with WebSocket later.
- **application logic** - The highlight and ranking number change based up the user's selections.

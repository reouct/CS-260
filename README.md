## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- **Header, footer, and main content body**
- **Navigation elements** - I dropped the underlines and changed the color for anchor elements.
- **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks great on all window sizes and devices
- **Application elements** - Used good contrast and whitespace
- **Application text content** - Consistent fonts
- **Application images** - Still don't have images and so no styling here. ðŸ˜”

## JavaScript deliverable

For this deliverable I implemented by JavaScript so that the application works for a single user. I also added placeholders for future technology.

- **login** - When you press enter or the login button it takes you to the create page.
- **database** - Click the submit button and the data will be stored. Currently this is stored and retrieved from local storage, but it will be replaced with the database data later.
- **WebSocket** - This will be implement with WebSocket later.
- **application logic** - Every time you refresh the About page, there will be a new quote displayed.

## Service deliverable

For this deliverable I added backend endpoints that receives votes and returns the voting totals.

- **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - done!
- **Static middleware for frontend** - done!
- **Calls to third party endpoints** - Every time you refresh the About page, there will be a new quote displayed.
- **Backend service endpoints** - Placeholders for login that stores the current user on the server.
- **Frontend calls service endpoints** - I did this using the fetch function in the About page.

## DB deliverable

For this deliverable I stored the votes in the database.

- **MongoDB Atlas database created** - done!
- **Endpoints for data** - My stubbed out endpoints now process the data and send it to Mongo.
- **Stores data in MongoDB** - done!

## Login deliverable

For this deliverable I associate the votes with the logged in user.

- **User registration** - Creates a new account in the database.
- **existing user** - Stores the votes under the same user if the user already exists.
- **Use MongoDB to store credentials** - Stores both user and their votes.
- **Restricts functionality** - You cannot vote until you have logged in. This is restricted on the frontend only. ðŸ˜”

## WebSocket deliverable

For this deliverable I used webSocket to update the votes on the frontend in realtime.

- **Backend listens for WebSocket connection** - done!
- **Frontend makes WebSocket connection** - done!
- **Data sent over WebSocket connection** - done!
- **WebSocket data displayed** - Users can chat in realtime. ðŸ˜”

## React deliverable

For this deliverable I converted the application over to use Vue. I know it is supposed to use React, but the instructor said I could use Vue because I already have extensive experience with React.

- **Bundled and transpiled** - done!
- **Components** - Login, voting list, vote are all components.
- **Router** - Routing between login and voting components.
- **Hooks** - Vue uses class properties instead of `UseState` to track changes in vote state.
